# UI5 Shaula

A collection of custom SAPUI5 controls engineered to replicate the capabilities of Smart Controls for OData V4. The focus is on metadata-driven UI generation, annotation-based configuration, and seamless integration with the SAPUI5 framework.

SAPâ€™s standard Smart Controls are limited to OData V2, whereas modern applications increasingly adopt OData V4 for enhanced performance, scalability, and advanced backend capabilities. This library addresses that gap by delivering metadata-driven UI generation and annotation-based behavior, facilitating the rapid development of consistent, Fiori-compliant applications.
